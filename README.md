MIDI TABBER v1.0.1
Evan Schirle

9/10/2018

This software writes bass guitar tabs from a programmed bass part (midi file)

My code makes use of Midicsv, which is some awesome open source software available at http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/

Currently this version only supports single-note parts on 4 string bass, standard tuning... 
but I intend on including capability for tabbing:
	chords, 
	guitar parts, 
	5-string bass / 7-string guitar, 
	and different tunings
	
TO RUN:

 - Ensure that Midicsv.exe is placed in the same folder as MidiTabber.exe
 - Run MidiTabber.exe
 
 OR 
 
 - Ensure that Midicsv.exe is placed in MidiTabber/bin/Debug
 - Open MidiTabber.sln with VisualStudio
 - Compile and run the code using the start button or by pressing F5
